      <h1>Welcome to my website! (Everything is placeholder)</h1>
      <p>This website was made for a project. It contains all the projects I have worked on and my CV and contact information. So maybe one day I can find a job as a programmer and create more amazing websites! </p>
      <p class="mt-2"> Some things about me. My favorite hobby (besides programing) is playing the guitar! I've been doing for 5 years now. My favorite colour is green (If you hadn't guessed). And i love skiing. However This is all just placeholder text at the moment so please don't take this so seriously. Thank you.</p>
