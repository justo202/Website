<h2>About</h2>
<p>The assignment was to create a reversi game using Java. The project took around 2 months to finish. However while making it I already had an idea of what i wanted to do and how it should look at the end. So I never got completely stuck.
This was my 1st time creating a GUI with java so I was unaware of some of the features. After creating the base game with 2 players I also added an option to play with a computer opponent. Computer opponent behaves quite simply by checking which move will get him the most points and proceding to do that move.</p>
