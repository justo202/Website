<h2>About</h2>
<p>The assignment was to create a repository using bash scripting</p>
<p>During this assignment my main idea was to create a console based menu, so that the user would always see his options and could choose from them and would never require to type long file names or paths to access certain functions. And I believe I have successfully achieved that.</p>
<p>I started by thinking small and 1st just created a way for the user to make a repository and see what’s inside, after I worked on letting the user create log comments and create backups for manually added files in the repository directory. Then I created the function to delete files and restore them using the backups. Then I decided to let the user create files and edit them through the script, which proved to be easier than expected. After that made it possible to delete repositories and zip them to a folder.</p>
<p>Being a complete novice in writing scripts it proved to be quite annoying and challenging to code. I used nano for writing the script and I really disliked it at first. It’s annoying not to be able to select items with your mouse and have to use arrow keys to move around the code that’s over 600 lines long as well as not being able to see the line number you are on. The syntax of bash also took time to get used to, because it’s similar to other programming languages but also quite different.</p>
