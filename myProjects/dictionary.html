<h2>About</h2>
<p>The goal of the project was to work in a team and create a translation program that would translate 2 languages. We choose English and French. We also added additional features to
add words to the dictionary and translate entire files.</p>
<p>I worked a lot on the GUI for this project, however I also assisted my group mates in completing their own tasks. This was also the first time I used datastructures like hashmaps which was quite interesting.</p>
