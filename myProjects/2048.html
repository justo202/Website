<h2>About</h2>
<p>A clone of a famous mobile game called 2048 that I helped create as part of a group assignment. This was also one of the first times I used github as a platform to alocate tasks and work together</p>
<p>I worked in a team of 3 people so I was mainly tasked with creating the GUI for it using C#.</p>
