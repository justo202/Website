<h2>About</h2>
<p>This was my first game I made using C#. It was part of an assignment I had in school. The main goal was to make a Tetris clone with the limited knowladge I had at the time, I also included a feature that saved the best scores of the player and loaded them back up every time the application started.
I took about 7 months to finish and the code was a bit messy and unoptimized but it worked and this project was one of the main reasons why I got into programing in the first place. Sadly, I lost the code of the game and only have screenshots.
